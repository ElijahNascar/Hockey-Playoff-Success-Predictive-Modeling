    "1. We needed to keep data only from the games of the ten seasons we wanted to use to build our model. We are keeping data from the 2007-08 season through the 2017-18 season. \n",
    "2. We can drop the columns in `game.csv` and `team_info.csv` that we know we will not use (`venue_link`, `franchiseId`, `abbreviation`, `link`).\n",
    "3. To get a full team name, we combined the variables `teamName` and `shortName` (and fixed the NY team names).\n",
    "4. To make it easier to identify which team played which games, we replaced `team_id` (a numerical value) in the game dataset with `team_name` from the team info dataset.\n",
    "5. We separated the games dataset into regular season games so that we do not factor playoff game data into our model. \n",
    "6. We dropped `team_id` from the team names dataset as it is no longer useful.\n",
    "7. Next, we wanted to get datasets for each season with each team's stats. We began by creating new columns with away and home wins and away and home losses. \n",
    "8. Then we separated the regular season game data into separate dataframes - one for each season. We also created the same amount of dataframes with just team names so that we can later fill in the season statistics data into these mostly empty dataframes.\n",
    "9. After that, we created some functions to fill in the team season statistics dataframes with predictors that we might be interested in.\n",
    "10. Then we got lists of all of the teams that made the playoffs in each season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below implements the above cleaning."
