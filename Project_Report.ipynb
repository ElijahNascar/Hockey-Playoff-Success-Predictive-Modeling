    "\tWhen considering topics for this project, Krish’s Fanclub first looked to apply data science to their collective interests. After deliberation, it became clear that in addition to a deep love for Python and statistics, as a group, we were also united by our interest in sports. So, as Northwestern students in the greater Chicago area, we first looked to focus our project on the main professional teams in Chicago: The Bulls, The Blackhawks, The Bears, and The Chicago Fire. We decided to center our project on The Blackhawks as the NHL season is in progress throughout all of winter quarter. When the project first started, the NHL season was around its halfway point. At this stage it can become clear which teams are the strongest, which are on the fence for reaching playoffs, and which teams are clearly out of the race for the postseason. With this in mind, Krish’s Fanclub took interest in determining the The Blackhawks’ chances in reaching the playoffs. This season The Blackhawks are playing very poorly, and it became clear upon inspection that any data analysis related to playoff chances would most likely produce results stating that The Blackhawks would not reach the postseason. For this reason, we turned our attention to The Nashville Predators, a team on the fence for playoff contention. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tData analytics has become more and more prevalent in the sports world. Now, MVP conversations, potential personnel lineups, and the chances of a team winning a game all include numbers and statistics. The power of analytics and its implications in the sports world were highlighted in the popular movie Moneyball. The film tells the true story of how the general manager for the baseball team the Oakland A’s used analytics to build a team and win games on an unprecedented level. Most professional sports teams today now have dedicated analytics teams to reveal insights that may give a winning edge. Motivated by this widespread movement, Krish’s fanclub decided to look at the Nashville Predators chances of reaching playoffs with the implications that the insight could potentially develop a clear strategy enabling the team to reach the postseason.\n"

    "The Nashville Predators, like any other NHL team, aspires to qualify for the playoffs. At the start of this project around halfway through the season, with 23 wins and 18 losses, the Predators chance to make the playoffs was slim. The objective of this research was to develop a linear regression model that predicted what the Nashville Predators had to do in the second half of their season to secure a playoff spot. To achieve this goal, we planned to train our model on data from the last 10 years of NHL teams that made the playoffs, incorporating factors such as wins, losses, home and away games, and goal differential.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the availability of information on professional sports publicly available, the data analyzed from this project was planned to be taken from sources such as NHL.com and Hockey-Reference.com. We planned to select the last 10 years of data as this provided a reasonable time frame that captured recent trends in the league. We also focused on teams that qualified for the playoffs in these years, as they represented a successful subset of the league. Factors such as wins, losses, home and away games, and goal differential were considered, as they were known to have a significant impact on team success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we were dealing with features that belong to both playoff and non-playoff teams, we knew we were dealing with a classification problem. Our goal was to develop a predictive model that could accurately classify a team as a playoff or non-playoff team based on their performance in the first half of the season. To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we sought to test it on a randomly selected playoff team from each of the 10 seasons, which was excluded from the training dataset. The false positive and false negative rates will be used to calculate the precision of our model, ensuring that it provides dependable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, we used the strongest predictors and performed transformations to achieve a better fit. After building a classification model, we planned to perform exploratory analysis in order to find the qualities of playoff teams. With this insight, we hoped to build a strategy that the Predator’s could implement to reach the playoffs. With insight that certain factors are more valuable than others, a strategy could allow the Predators to focus efforts on areas that have the largest impact on reaching the postseason. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, our research aimed to provide the Nashville Predators with valuable insights into their odds for reaching the playoffs and what they needed to do to qualify. By developing a data-driven approach to team performance, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the team's success on the ice.\n"

    "The three main stakeholders identified that could benefit from our project were The Nashville Predators organization, sports betting companies, and Predators fans. The Nashville Predators organization were classified as stakeholders as insight into how to reach playoffs and the odds of reaching playoffs could be very valuable for the general manager as well as coaches and players. If a strategy to reach the playoffs could be formulated, then coaches could focus their efforts in certain areas that would have the most effect on the team’s success. Coaches could know when to rest players on games that were less important, and when to play the best players for vital games. For a general manager who runs the organization at a higher level, insight from our project could help the manager decide on coaching staff to reach the playoffs. Before our analysis, we rationalized that if away wins were identified to be more important than home wins, then a general manager might focus on finding coaches who were more successful at getting teams to win at away games.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Sports betting companies were identified as stakeholders due to the connection between sports betting and analytics. Sports betting lines attempt to emulate the odds of certain outcomes while also adjusting to the money placed on either side of the bet. In order to create these lines, sports betting organizations use complex algorithms taking in many predictors and past information as a base point. Oftentimes, sports betting lines reflect the probability events will occur in the form of the payouts they generate. Sports betting companies could benefit from our project if we are successful as our insight may help these companies adjust their betting lines to be more in line with our predicted odds that the Predators’ reach the playoffs. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "Dedicated fans of sports teams consume large amounts of information on their favorite teams. This is evident from media sources such as The Athletic which provides fans with news on each of their favorite teams. Some of the most popular information on sports teams is a team’s success and their odds of reaching the playoffs. If our project is successful, dedicated Predators’ fans will want to understand our results in order to learn more about their team’s current standing. Furthermore, media outlets spreading information about the Predator’s will find our results relevant and a potential source of revenue for generating views to their websites and publications. \n"
