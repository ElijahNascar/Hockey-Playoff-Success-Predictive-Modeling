# Hockey Playoff Success Predictive Modeling
STAT 303-2 Final Project: Krish's Fanclub

The Nashville Predators, like any other NHL team, aspires to qualify for the playoffs. At the start of this project around halfway through the season, with 23 wins and 18 losses, the Predators chance to make the playoffs was slim. The objective of this research was to develop a linear regression model that predicted what the Nashville Predators had to do in the second half of their season to secure a playoff spot. To achieve this goal, we planned to train our model on data from the last 10 years of NHL teams that made the playoffs, incorporating factors such as wins, losses, home and away games, and goal differential.

With the availability of information on professional sports publicly available, the data analyzed from this project was planned to be taken from sources such as NHL.com and Hockey-Reference.com. We planned to select the last 10 years of data as this provided a reasonable time frame that captured recent trends in the league. We also focused on teams that qualified for the playoffs in these years, as they represented a successful subset of the league. Factors such as wins, losses, home and away games, and goal differential were considered, as they were known to have a significant impact on team success.

Since we were dealing with features that belong to both playoff and non-playoff teams, we knew we were dealing with a classification problem. Our goal was to develop a predictive model that could accurately classify a team as a playoff or non-playoff team based on their performance in the first half of the season. To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we sought to test it on a randomly selected playoff team from each of the 10 seasons, which was excluded from the training dataset. The false positive and false negative rates will be used to calculate the precision of our model, ensuring that it provides dependable predictions.

To improve the model, we used the strongest predictors and performed transformations to achieve a better fit. After building a classification model, we planned to perform exploratory analysis in order to find the qualities of playoff teams. With this insight, we hoped to build a strategy that the Predatorâ€™s could implement to reach the playoffs. With insight that certain factors are more valuable than others, a strategy could allow the Predators to focus efforts on areas that have the largest impact on reaching the postseason.

Ultimately, our research aimed to provide the Nashville Predators with valuable insights into their odds for reaching the playoffs and what they needed to do to qualify. By developing a data-driven approach to team performance, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the team's success on the ice.
